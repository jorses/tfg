# Bachelor's Thesis
## Double Major in Mathematics and Computer Science, Complutense University of Madrid

In this repo you will find the coding work done to implement the basis of a CBR based report system for my final degree thesis. 

If you just want to take a general look at the work done, an implementation of the backend modules with some simplified metrics can be easily tested from notebooks/demo.ipynb, while in notebooks/test_notas.ipynb you will find the first version of an interactive polling tournament.

Other notebooks include earlier versions or iterations over the same concepts, and an earlier fleshout of the objectives is listed (in spanish) in tareas.md, although most of it was modified and/or iterated onto other concepts.

In the tex folder you can find the source code for the thesis' latex, developed with the wonderful latex template TeXiS, which you can find at http://gaia.fdi.ucm.es/research/texis/.

In src you can find an early django server concept for the poller which was finally not included in the final version, scraped in favor of the notebook, and some module concepts adapted to work with this server.
